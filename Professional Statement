TL;DR
I am an ethically-driven computer scientist that thrives on helping people, and I have always had a "better-safe than sorry" mentality. I am capable of bringing together groups of people, whether that be through helping people understand difficult topics, or simply helping groups to work together.

- Programming
  -> I graduated from Syracuse University with multiple semesters on the Dean's List with a degree in computer science. This allowed me to accumulated necessary skills such as utilizing languages like Python, Java, C++, C, and SQL.

Cybersecurity allows you to be the superhero and take down the villains, and that feeds perfectly into my commitment to ethics
