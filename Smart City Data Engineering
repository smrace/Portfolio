This project is intended to get a variety of information such as vehicle information, GPS information, camera information, weather,
  and emergency (police, ambulance, fire, etc.).
The information will track a car going from London to Birmingham

The information will flow from the source to Kafka whcih will be controlled by Apache Zookeeper. Apache Spark will be the consumer
  listen for the data and stream it to Amazon S3. We will use a data catalog and AWS Glue to write the data from the catalog. 
  The data will then be connected to Amazon Redshift (could use Athena as well but I will mainly be using that for quering and 
  visualizing). All of this section will be controlled and secured by AWS IAM.
